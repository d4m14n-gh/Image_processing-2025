# ImageProcessingLectureSupportSystem

This project is an educational web application designed to support the teaching and learning of image processing concepts. Built with Angular and Angular Material, it provides interactive visualizations and tools for exploring various image processing algorithms and techniques. Key features include bitmap editing, step-by-step animation of convolutional and median filters, morphological operations, histogram analysis, and Hough transform visualization. The application allows users to experiment with different parameters, observe algorithm behavior in real time, and gain a deeper understanding of fundamental image processing operations. Its modular structure and user-friendly interface make it suitable for both classroom demonstrations and individual study.


## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Documentation

To generate documentation, use the following command:

```bash
npm run compodoc
```
